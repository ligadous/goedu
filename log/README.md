## Log ##

Use of log package with webserver

Turn ON/OFF log DEBUG on the fly 

Based in the great post of Dave Cheney http://dave.cheney.net/2015/11/05/lets-talk-about-logging

We need olny two type os logging, ERROR and DEBUG

Like major off my systems, many others systens are built and monitoring for one person only.
Its a interesante thing, change on the fly if the log write debug messages or simple discard it, so I test it on a web system example.
